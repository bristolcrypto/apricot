=========== OT Extension ==========

Requirements:

 - GCC and CPU supporting PCLMUL, AES-NI, and SSE4.1.

To run the OT extension protocol:

 - Make ot.x
 - Run ot.x -p 0 and then ot.x -p 1 to run the OT extension between two parties
 - For a full list of possible options, run ot.x
 - We have measured 69 seconds on a local link with -n 1000000000 -l 100 -x 50

Further comments:

 - OTExtensionWithMatrix (used by default) is the optimized extension
   for 128-bit OT. OTExtension is slower but more flexible.
 - Secure base OT computation is not implemented. If you wish to
   implement it, do so in BaseOT::exec_base(). Refer to
   FakeOT::exec_base() for the desired output.
 - ot-check.x allows to check the output of ot.x.
 - ot-bitmatrix.x is a unit test for the BitMatrix class.
 - This has only been tested on Linux.
 - Parts of the code use a C implementation of AES, which has been
   removed.
